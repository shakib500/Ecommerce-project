         <button class="accordion">5.1 Performance Recquirments:</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p>To maintain an allowable maximum speed for the system for maximum usage of the customer, any number of customers can access the system at any time in that speed.</p>
         </div>
         <button class="accordion">5.2 Safety Recquirments:</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p>The application will not affect data stored outside of its server nor will it affect any other web applications. It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components. The only potential safety concern associated with this application applies to virtually all handset apps. This app should not be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the user's attention must be focused elsewhere. </p>
         </div>
         <button class="accordion">5.3. Security Recquirments:</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p>Since this software will be hosted on erver, all the user data will be kept on the server. Product should be able to protect privacy of user data. Workspace of the user should only be
               accessed through user own credentials and any other user should not be able to access to the user
               private data.
            </p>
            <p>Since execution will also be done in the machine in the server, user should be restricted in
               terms of user rights. User should only access to his own workspace and should not access to any
               other workspace with the programs they run on the server. Also rights of the user should be
               restricted so that user can not harm to system by the programs they run or by the commands they
               run on terminal.
            </p>
            <p>Since all the data will be transferred on the web, system should also use an encryption and
               decryption mechanism only intended user can decode the data and work on the data. 
            </p>
         </div>
         <button class="accordion">5.4. Software quality attributes:</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p>This software is easy to use for both developers and customers. Some important attributes of our software are that it is secured, usable, available, well performed. Some other attributes that we worked on are scalability, robustness, operability, maintainability.  We also worked on voice search so that illiterate people can use it. We emphasized more on simplicity rather than superiority so that common people find it easy to use. </p>
         </div>
         <button class="accordion">5.5. Business rules:</button>
         <div class="panel">
            <p>Our software will be built in such a way that it will be reliable to all. Security is our main concern so that it doesn't make any mistake and in case of an error it will have a system so that our customers can get refund. We will also ensure that our customers and salesman both can easily solve a transaction error. Our voice search system will be based on Asian accent so that common people don't find any problem to select their product. If possible we will add suggestions to the voice search. </p>
