      <h1>Business Case and Relevance</h1>
      <h1>to Gartner's Prediction</h1>
      <h2>From Gartner's top predictions of 2018 and beyond one of the important prediction is:</h2> 
      <p><b>By 2021, early adopter brands that redesign their websites to support visual and voice search will increase digital commerce revenue by 30%.</b></p>
      <p>We are planning a project where we will create an eCommerce website. In our website we will try to implement this voice search and also will try to implement multiple voice searches so that it will help our digital commerce revenue. <b>According to Gartner, half of major commerce companies and retailers with online stores will have redesigned their commerce sites to accommodate voice searches and voice navigation within 2019.</b> Now it is 2018 and from Gartnerâ€™s point of view, if we add the voice search mechanism in our eCommerce project, it will give us a good chance to hold our eCommerce site in the future market. </p>

      <p><b>Our Project plan:</b></p>
      <p>We will two types of search system in our project. </p>
          <p>1. Manual search</p>
          <p>2. Voice search</p>
      <p>Both search system will allow the customers to search for items one by one and also to make a list of items by typing or uttering the names correctly first; after that, the search operation will work. And then the customers can add items of their choice to the shopping cart and bill will be charged according to the selected items. Payment system will be - cash on delivery.</p>

      <p><b>Business Case:</b></p>
      <p>At this current era of technology, people are less likely to spend their valuable time on shopping. So different eCommerce sites are developed and they are giving brilliant services to people. But people are getting busier and technology dependant, so they are searching for more ease. For providing that comfort to people, we are here with an idea of creating the simplest way of shopping; that is an<i> <q>eCommerce System with Multiple and Voice Search facility</q></i>.</p>
      <p>The features of multiple and voice search in the website will allow customers to affect a purchase with a single utterance which will help our project to gain competitive advantage in customer satisfaction and thus in market share.</p> 

      <p><b>Mission our project:</b> To ensure maximum level of customer satisfaction</p>
      <p><b>Vision of our project:</b> To update the system regularly with newer technologies. </p>
